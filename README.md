# Neural-encoding-and-decoding-using-GANS

This was a group project consisting of 2 members for the course AI For Neurotechnology offered at Radboud University, Nijmegen, the Netherlands. It is a walk-through for understanding the basic usage of the GAN/PG-GAN latent space and employing them for neural encoding and decoding of fMRI data.

Note: The customized loss function is not optimized and still needs some modifications.
